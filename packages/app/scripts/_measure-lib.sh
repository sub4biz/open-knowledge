# invoking entry point); when they match, we're being run directly.

# ── Atomic JSONL append ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Shell `>>` append is only atomic for payloads ≤ PIPE_BUF (4096 bytes on
# Linux) and is NOT atomic at any size on macOS. A fuzz record with many
# failing seeds + long --context can exceed 4 KB and would interleave with
# a concurrent measure:stress run appending to the same log, corrupting
# the JSONL trend record. Guard with flock on Linux; fall back to mkdir-
# based mutex on macOS (flock is not in the BSD toolchain).
#
# On lock failure (timeout, crash-left lockdir, filesystem error), the
# helper now EXITS NON-ZERO rather than warn-and-proceed. The JSONL is
# the spec-named evidence trail (NG6 of the CI signal quality spec) —
# silently dropping or non-atomically appending to it is worse than
# surfacing the failure to the caller who can decide whether to retry,
# investigate, or escalate.
#
# Stale-lock recovery: on the mkdir fallback path, if the lockdir exists
# and its mtime is older than 60s, treat it as a crashed-writer artifact
# (a Ctrl-C between mkdir and rmdir would leave this behind). Remove it
# and retry once before giving up. 60s is conservative — a real writer
# completes its jsonl append in well under a second.
#
# flock vs mkdir-mutex asymmetry (both paths hit the same 10-second
# timeout budget):
#   - `flock -w 10`: kernel-managed wait, no CPU cost while blocked.
#     Cheapest and preferred. Linux-only (flock is not in the BSD
#     toolchain).
#   - mkdir-mutex (macOS fallback): busy-waits with `sleep 0.1`
#     (100ms) polling, up to 100 iterations. CPU cost is negligible
#     at this polling frequency but NOT zero — the shell wakes ~10×/s
#     to re-attempt mkdir. Functional parity with flock for
#     correctness; lower efficiency under contention. Not worth
#     optimizing (concurrent measurement runs are rare and the budget
#     is bounded).

/**
 * Persistent "Ask AI" composer docked as a slim single-line field directly
 * above the editor footer (and above the docked terminal when it is open).
 *
 * It is always present while a doc is open — a short, single-line input at rest
 * that auto-grows as the instruction spans multiple lines, wrapped in a rounded
 * card that owns the focus ring. It carries a segmented "Ask <agent>" send
 * control (the shared `AgentSplitButton`: primary submit + joined agent-picker
 * chevron), a rotating-suggestion placeholder that cross-fades between prompts
 * while empty, and the ⌘L focus shortcut. Because it is an in-flow flex child of
 * the editor column (not a floating overlay), the terminal dock pushes it up as
 * it expands instead of overlapping it.
 *
 * Submitting dispatches the typed instruction to the resolved default agent
 * (first installed, or the user's sticky pick) scoped to the current doc, via
 * the shared handoff plumbing (`useHandoffDispatch` -> ask-scope input ->
 * `composeAskPrompt`). Picking a Terminal CLI (Claude / Codex / Cursor) hands
 * the composed prompt to the docked terminal instead of a deep-link dispatch —
 * injecting into a matching idle session if one is open, else a new tab.

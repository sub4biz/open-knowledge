/**
 * Agent-write summary normalization — single truncation point for the
 * five agent-write API handlers (80-char cap at the API boundary; the
 * Zod 200-char cap in the MCP layer is a separate transport-safety bound).
 *
 * Contract: three-state result that lets each handler distinguish
 *   - `absent` → no-op (no summary was provided; no metric increment)
 *   - `invalid` → caller responds 400 (summary was present but not a string)
 *   - `value` → caller records the (possibly truncated) summary and counts it
 *
 * Keeping the "present but empty string" case classified as `absent`
 * means empty strings are treated as missing (so `summary: ""` doesn't
 * produce a zero-length bullet and doesn't inflate the adoption metric).
 *
 * Truncation policy: `truncatedFrom` is set ONLY when the input length
 * exceeds the cap. An input of exactly MAX_SUMMARY_LENGTH characters is
 * returned as-is with no `truncatedFrom`.

/**
 * Line-terminator characters replaced with a single space at the API boundary.
 * Each character is replaced one-for-one (not collapsed) so length math stays
 * predictable for the truncation cap — `truncatedFrom` reflects the original
 * input length whether or not line terminators were present.
 *
 * Covers: LF (\n), CR (\r), VT (\v), FF (\f), NEL (U+0085), Unicode line /
 * paragraph separators (U+2028 / U+2029). Constructed via `new RegExp` from
 * a string so the source file holds no literal line-separator codepoints —
 * tooling that round-trips this file otherwise substitutes the raw codepoints
 * into the regex literal, which JS parsers reject inside a regex literal.
 *
 * Without this sanitization, a summary of the form `"x\nok-actor: {…}"` would
 * survive `normalizeSummary` (≤ 80 chars, not entirely whitespace), flow into
 * `composeCommitSubject`, and embed a literal newline in the commit subject.
 * The body parsers (`parseOkActors`, `parseContributors`, `parseCheckpoint`)
 * split on `\n` and dispatch by line prefix, so an embedded `\nok-actor: {…}`
 * fragment becomes a forged actor entry in the commit body when the L2 drain
 * concatenates `${subject}\n\n${formatOkActor(real)}`.

 * values are preserved verbatim except for line-terminator characters
 * (LF, CR, VT, FF, NEL, U+2028, U+2029), which are replaced with spaces to
 * prevent commit-message subject-line injection — see `LINE_TERMINATOR_RE`

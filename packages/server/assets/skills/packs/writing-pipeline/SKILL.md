Carries the stage flow and review behaviors so that guidance does not live inside template bodies or folder descriptions. Complements the platform `open-knowledge` skill; does not replace it."

# Writing Pipeline pack — how to work here

A lean three-stage flow for short-to-medium-form writing (essays, newsletters, blog posts):

```
ideas/      one-line premises, captured before they fade
   ↓ commit to writing it
drafts/     active prose; CRDT history covers revisions (no named-revision folders)
   ↓ ship
published/  shipped work; treat as immutable
```

## Per-folder rules + agent behaviors

- **`ideas/`** — premises, headlines, fragments. Kept short on purpose; not a draft folder. Promote into `drafts/` when you commit to the piece. *Agent: review ideas idle more than 30 days and surface them to park or promote.*
- **`drafts/`** — active prose. Frontmatter tracks `status: drafting/review`, word count, parent idea. *Agent: review drafts idle more than 14 days; for drafts in review, suggest publication targets based on `target_form`. If a piece needs research notes, create `drafts/<slug>/research/` on demand rather than a top-level folder.*
- **`published/`** — shipped work; carries `published_at`, `canonical_url`, `channel`. Treat as immutable; to revise, copy to a new draft. *Agent: on publish, auto-fill `canonical_url` when a Substack / Ghost / Mirror URL is pasted into the file.*

## Templates

Create with `write({ document: { path, template: "<name>" } })`. Templates carry only structure; section meaning lives here, not in the document body.

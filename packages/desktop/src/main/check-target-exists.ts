/**
 * Lightweight `<projectPath>/<path>` existence probe for the share-receive
 * Q1 pre-server target check. Runs after the `.git/HEAD` branch comparison
 * passes — answers "does the target the share links to actually exist on the
 * current working tree?" Without this gate, a share-link whose target does
 * not exist on the receiver's locally checked-out branch (typical
 * stale-branch scenario: the receiver has not `git fetch`ed since the target
 * was added on the remote branch) opens a blank editor with no signal.
 *
 * Kind-aware: a `doc` target probes for a regular file
 * (`<path>` resolves to a non-directory `statSync`); a `folder` target
 * probes for a directory (`statSync(<path>).isDirectory()`). The result
 * shape (`exists | missing | unreadable`) is identical across kinds; only
 * the on-disk predicate differs. Content-root folder shares (empty path)
 * skip this probe entirely at the call site — the root always exists — so
 * this function never receives an empty `path`.
 *
 * Q1 runs before any project is opened — no server, no `simple-git`. The
 * receiver is choosing between silent dispatch (target present) and
 * surfacing a "missing on branch" toast (target absent); a graceful fail
 * must collapse to silent dispatch so a single broken project never blocks
 * a share-receive that the file system happens to refuse to stat.
 *
 * Safety mirrors `read-head-branch.ts`'s `isSafeProjectPath`, plus a stricter
 * relative-path discipline on `path`: must NOT be absolute, must NOT
 * contain `..` segments, must resolve inside `projectPath` (`realpath` is
 * not used — symlinks are honoured by the existing project semantics, the
 * containment check uses lexical resolution).

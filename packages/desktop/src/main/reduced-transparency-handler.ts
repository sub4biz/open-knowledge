/**
 * Pure handler for the `prefers-reduced-transparency` runtime path.
 *
 * The renderer's `ConfigProvider` matchMedia listener fires
 * `signalThemeApplied({ reducedTransparency })` whenever the user enables /
 * disables System Settings → Accessibility → Display → Reduce transparency.
 * Main observes through the existing `ok:theme:applied` IPC dispatch (the
 * payload is widened rather than adding a new channel — every additional
 * hand-rolled IPC channel is committed to trigger the typed-ipc framework
 * migration before it lands) and calls this handler to toggle vibrancy
 * material on every BrowserWindow.
 *
 * Architectural boundaries — three things this handler does NOT do:
 *   1. CSS-side fallback. The matching `@media (prefers-reduced-transparency:
 *      reduce)` block in globals.css reverts the alpha-aware outer canvas
 *      to solid `var(--sidebar)` — the renderer side is purely declarative
 *      and runs whether or not `window.okDesktop` is present.
 *   2. Per-window material differentiation. All open windows share the
 *      Electron one-vibrancy-per-window constraint; the runtime toggle
 *      applies uniformly.
 *   3. State.json caching. The preference is observed live via matchMedia
 *      and recovers on cold-launch by the same path; nothing to cache.
 *
 * The trust-boundary classification is unambiguous: data crosses the
 * renderer→main process seam, arrives via IPC marshaling, and the read
 * happens in the imperative shell — same boundary as `applyThemeSource`.
 * A guard on `isDestroyed?.()` is appropriate because
 * `BrowserWindow.getAllWindows()` may include a destroyed window between
 * the `closed` event and the next GC pass; calling `setVibrancy` on a
 * destroyed window throws in Electron.

/**
 * Per-window memo of the last vibrancy material THIS handler applied. Lets
 * `applyReducedTransparency` skip a window already at the target material
 * instead of re-issuing `setVibrancy`.
 *
 * Why it exists: a theme change (light↔dark) re-sends the *unchanged*
 * `reducedTransparency` on every open window through the multiplexed
 * `ok:theme:applied` channel — yet the vibrancy material does NOT depend on
 * light/dark (it auto-tracks `nativeTheme.themeSource` at the
 * NSVisualEffectView level), so those re-applies are pure redundant work.
 * With N project windows open, one toggle propagates to all N (each fires the
 * signal) and each fan-out touches all N windows — N² `setVibrancy` calls in
 * a ~300 ms burst. On `transparent: true` windows every call rebuilds the
 * NSVisualEffectView, which visibly flickers the translucent chrome of the
 * non-focused windows. The memo collapses that burst to zero once each window
 * sits at the steady material.
 *
 * Keyed on window object identity (`BrowserWindow.getAllWindows()` returns
 * stable instances); a closed window is GC'd and its entry auto-drops. A new
 * window is absent from the map and so is applied once; a genuine
 * reduced-transparency toggle changes the material and so still fans out.
 *
 * Module-level (not a `deps` field) so every caller is idempotent for free —
 * no wiring to forget — and so the pure-DI dep surface stays unchanged.

 *
 * Each `setVibrancy` call is wrapped in a per-window try/catch so a throw on
 * any one window does not abort the loop. The `isDestroyed` guard handles
 * the common shutdown race; the catch isolates against the residual cases —
 * close events that fire between the guard and the native call, or

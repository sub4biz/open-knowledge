/**
 * Typed IPC request channel map (renderer → main, request/response pattern).
 *
 * Hand-rolled discriminated union (not tRPC/tipc): every channel name is a
 * top-level key in `RequestChannels`; each key maps to
 * `{ args: [...]; result: T }`. The preload-side `invoke<K>()` helper (see
 * `./ipc-invoke.ts`) uses these types for full autocomplete + compile-time
 * safety. Grep-able channel names are the primary observability — a
 * channel name tells you exactly where the handler lives in main and where
 * the caller lives in renderer without touching a debugger.
 *
 * Scale-match trigger: at >20 channels, migrate baseline to
 * `@electron-toolkit/typed-ipc` or `@egoist/tipc` — well past the trigger;
 * migrate before adding another batch. The channel count is pinned by
 * `tests/integration/ipc-channel-count-ratchet.test.ts` (a one-way ratchet);
 * every bump carries a documented could-not-fold rationale there.
 *
 * The docked-terminal PTY surface (`ok:pty:create` + the fire-and-forget
 * `input`/`resize`/`kill`/`drain`, plus the reload-survival `list`/`adopt`)
 * could not be folded: the STOP rule forbids any arbitrary-exec IPC outside the
 * `ok:pty:*` framing, and they are the smallest faithful PTY protocol. Streaming
 * output + exit ride `EventChannels` (`ok:pty:data` / `ok:pty:exit`). The
 * `ok:terminal:*` reads — `claude-assist` (Claude readiness preflight + MCP
 * re-arm) and `dock-state` (per-window dock visibility, read on reload) — are
 * NOT exec channels. The full could-not-fold rationale lives in the ratchet test.
 * Sidebar tree-state directives (`ok:sidebar:expand-all` /
 * `ok:sidebar:collapse-all`) ship as `EventChannels` entries instead because
 * they are main→renderer pushes. The team's commitment remains: migrate to
 * typed-ipc before any further channel additions; payload-widening on
 * existing channels is preferred over net-new hand-rolled channels until
 * that migration lands.
 *
 * Count is 76 (ratchet cap 76). Full rationale in the ratchet test header.

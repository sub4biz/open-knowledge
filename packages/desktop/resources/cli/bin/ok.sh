# while-loop handles readlink failures inline (by checking `[ -h "$SOURCE" ]`
# before each iteration), and the final `exit $?` semantic requires a
# non-zero exit to propagate from the exec'd CLI — `set -e` would short-
# circuit both patterns. Matches VS Code's `code.sh` reference (same
# omission, same rationale).

# Dock-less helper redirect for the long-lived background servers. `ok mcp`
# and `ok start` boot the collab server in-process as the ENTRY process —
# unlike spawned children (redirected by self-spawn.ts /
# resolve-detached-spawn-args.ts), nothing rewrites them to the LSUIElement
# helper, so LaunchServices parks a generic "exec" Dock tile against the main
# binary for the server's whole lifetime. Prefer the sibling helper bundle
# (its Info.plist declares LSUIElement=true → no Dock tile) for these
# subcommands when present; fall back to the main binary for older bundles and
# npm-global installs that have no .app. The default `ok` (and every other
# subcommand) keeps the main binary — it is a real foreground desktop app.
#
# The two literals below are a 5th encoding of the helper bundle dir +
# executable basename and MUST stay in sync with HELPER_BUNDLE_NAME /
# HELPER_EXECUTABLE_NAME in packages/core/src/helper-bundle.ts
# (helper-bundle-name-agreement.test.ts pins the agreement). The executable
# basename MUST remain "OpenKnowledge Helper": Electron's
# ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE boot reads its own basename via _NSGetExecutablePath()
# and SIGTRAPs on any other name.

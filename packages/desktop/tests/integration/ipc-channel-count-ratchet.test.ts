/**
 * Mechanical ratchet for the hand-rolled IPC channel surface.
 *
 * `ipc-channels.ts`'s file header commits the team to migrating off the
 * hand-rolled discriminated union (to `@egoist/tipc` or
 * `@electron-toolkit/typed-ipc`) BEFORE adding any further channels — the
 * channel count is well past the scale-match trigger documented in the
 * header. Without a CI gate, that commitment is purely social: a future
 * contributor can add another channel and the typed-ipc migration silently
 * defers.
 *
 * The ratchet parses the `RequestChannels` interface declaration in
 * `ipc-channels.ts`, counts the channel-key entries (`'ok:<surface>:<verb>'`),
 * and fails when the count exceeds the committed cap. Forward direction:
 * the cap moves with intentional changes to the cap constant, not with
 * incidental channel additions.
 *
 * Mirrors `no-loosely-typed-webcontents-ipc.test.ts`'s shape — a Bun test
 * with grep-walk over the source. Same enforcement guarantee, same `bun
 * run check` gating.

/**
 * Maximum hand-rolled request channels permitted before the typed-ipc
 * migration must land. Bumped from 55 to 59 with four channels added by
 * the share-receive branch-aware flow:
 *
 *   - `ok:project:read-head-branch` — pre-server branch-mismatch
 *     detection. Reads `<projectPath>/.git/HEAD` directly from main; no
 *     server is running yet at silent-dispatch time, so the existing
 *     `GET /api/git/branch-info` HTTP read is unreachable.
 *   - `ok:project:fetch-branch-info` — proxies `GET /api/git/branch-info`
 *     against the project's running server. Main owns the HTTP call
 *     because the dispatcher window does not carry the project's
 *     apiOrigin; the proxy resolves the server lock and routes the GET.
 *   - `ok:project:run-checkout` — proxies `POST /api/git/checkout` for
 *     the same dispatcher-to-project routing reason as fetch-branch-info,
 *     but for the write surface. Returns immediately on git success; the
 *     post-checkout wait is an orthogonal channel.
 *   - `ok:project:await-branch-switched` — gates the dialog's dismissal
 *     on the CC1 `branch-switched` broadcast landing in the project
 *     window. Main polls the project's `GET /api/server-info` (the
 *     late-join backstop for the broadcast) until `currentBranch`
 *     matches. Could not fold into `run-checkout` because the dialog
 *     flows through `runCheckout` → `awaiting-cc1-recycle` →
 *     `awaitBranchSwitched` as separate reducer phases — folding would
 *     couple the write-response timing to the broadcast-wait timing.
 *
 * Bumped from 59 to 60 with the stale-branch fix:
 *
 *   - `ok:project:check-target-exists` — pre-server target-existence
 *     probe. After the branch-name comparison passes, probes
 *     `<projectPath>/<docPath>` on the working tree. Without this gate,
 *     a receiver whose locally checked-out branch matches the share but
 *     hasn't fetched the commit that adds the file (typical stale-branch
 *     scenario) silently opens a blank editor. Could not fold into
 *     `read-head-branch` because the two probes have orthogonal
 *     responsibilities (branch state vs file presence) and folding
 *     would conflate the schemas; the cost is one channel, the win is
 *     a clean single-responsibility surface that's easy to test in
 *     isolation.
 *
 * Bumped from 60 to 62 with the multi-worktree share-receive flow:
 *
 *   - `ok:project:list-git-worktrees` — runs `git worktree list
 *     --porcelain` rooted at an anchor path and returns realpath-collapsed
 *     entries. The candidate-selection algorithm needs to see worktrees
 *     beyond the Recents list (CLI-managed worktrees the user has never
 *     opened in OK still become first-class share-receive candidates).
 *     Could not fold into `read-head-branch` because the responsibilities
 *     differ — that probe reads ONE worktree's HEAD; this one enumerates
 *     ALL worktrees in the repo. Different shapes, different failure
 *     modes (parser-tolerance vs symbolic-ref parsing).
 *   - `ok:project:read-git-dir-kind` — classifies `<projectPath>/.git`
 *     as `'directory'` (main checkout), `'linked'` (worktree pointer),
 *     or `'absent'` / `'malformed-pointer'` / `'inaccessible'`. Used by
 *     the candidate-selection fallback to prefer main checkouts over
 *     linked worktrees when no branch-match exists (switching main is
 *     safe; switching a worktree off its branch defeats its purpose).
 *     A thin wrapper around `resolveGitDirDetailed` from core — chosen
 *     over a richer combined `inspectCandidate` IPC to preserve
 *     composability (separate `readHeadBranch` + `readGitDirKind` +
 *     `findEnclosingProjectRoot` calls reuse existing primitives;
 *     a combined call would duplicate logic and complicate testing).
 *
 * Bumped from 62 to 63 with the multi-worktree share-receive
 * consent flow's Navigator transport:
 *
 *   - `ok:project:ok-init` — runs the share-receive scaffold
 *     (`initContent`) directly from main. The HTTP route
 *     `POST /api/local-op/ok-init` exists for the Editor-App-window
 *     code path, but the consent dialog mounts in the Navigator
 *     window before any project utility server exists for the
 *     candidate path. The Navigator's `apiOrigin === ''`, so a
 *     relative fetch would never reach a server — sibling Navigator
 *     flows (`localOp.clone`, `localOp.auth.*`) ship IPC transports
 *     for exactly this constraint. Could not fold into
 *     `read-git-dir-kind` or `find-enclosing-project-root` because
 *     this is the only write surface among the share-receive
 *     candidate-selection IPCs — folding would mix a mutator into
 *     a read-only group.
 *
 * All eight of the share-receive additions extend the existing
 * `bridge.project.*` namespace rather than introducing new top-level
 * channel namespaces. The typed-ipc migration remains deferred; raising
 * the cap again must coincide with either the migration landing or
 * another scoped exception with the same explicit commitment update in
 * the `ipc-channels.ts` header comment.
 *
 * Bumped from 63 to 64 with the multi-worktree share-receive dedupe fix:
 *
 *   - `ok:project:realpath` — canonicalizes a path via the OS realpath so
 *     the candidate-selection step can collapse Recents paths (stored as
 *     the user opened them, possibly pre-canonical) onto the same realpath
 *     identity `list-git-worktrees` already emits. Without it, a Recents
 *     entry at `/var/...` and a worktree-enum entry at `/private/var/...`
 *     (the same physical dir on macOS) produce two Candidate rows for one
 *     directory, spuriously flipping `multiCandidate` true and firing the
 *     ambiguous-branch-match diagnostic on a non-ambiguity. The renderer
 *     is pure (no `node:fs`), so canonicalization must cross to main.
 *     Could not fold into any sibling: it returns a bare `string`, whereas
 *     `read-git-dir-kind` returns a kind enum and `find-enclosing-*` return
 *     structured results — folding would conflate the schemas.
 *
 * Bumped from 64 to 65 for the OK config sharing-mode feature:
 *
 *   - `ok:sharing:dispatch` — single discriminated-args channel covering both
 *     the read (`status`) and the write (`set-mode`) for the per-project
 *     sharing toggle. Consolidated into one channel so the addition is
 *     +1 instead of +2. Could not fold into existing project channels:
 *     none of them carry a discriminated-payload precedent today, and
 *     `ok:state:query` returns a different shape that's already
 *     gated by an unrelated discriminant.
 *
 * Bumped from 65 to 66 with the desktop version-drift restart flow:
 *
 *   - `ok:project:restart-server` — terminates the attached (not-owned)
 *     server a window connected to and recreates the window against a fresh
 *     own-version spawn. Renderer-initiated from the version-drift
 *     notification's action button. Could not fold into `ok:project:open`:
 *     that channel focuses an already-open project and requires a Navigator
 *     `entryPoint`, whereas restart is invoked from an editor window for the
 *     project it is already attached to, and it must first terminate a
 *     running server (a destructive side effect alien to the open path).
 *     Could not fold into `ok:project:close` (no respawn, no result) or
 *     `ok:update:relaunch-now` (relaunches the whole app, not one project's
 *     server). It is the only channel whose result is consumed solely on
 *     failure — success recreates the originating window, so its invoke never
 *     resolves. Distinct direction, semantics, and result shape from all 65
 *     siblings. The typed-ipc migration remains the committed end state; this
 *     is a scoped exception with the header-comment commitment updated in
 *     lock-step (per the same rule the share-receive additions followed).
 *
 * Bumped from 66 to 71 with the docked-terminal `ok:pty:*` PTY surface:
 *
 *   - `ok:pty:create` — fork/spawn a window-bound PTY at the project root,
 *     returns the new ptyId (or `no-project`).
 *   - `ok:pty:input` / `ok:pty:resize` / `ok:pty:kill` — fire-and-forget
 *     keystroke / fit / teardown, keyed by ptyId.
 *   - `ok:pty:drain` — the renderer's backpressure ack (consumed byte count)
 *     gating node-pty `resume()` on a flood-paused PTY. No existing channel
 *     carries renderer→main flow-control semantics to fold it into; it is the
 *     no-precedent backpressure seam.
 *
 *   These could NOT fold into existing channels and could NOT collapse into
 *   each other: the STOP rule forbids any arbitrary-exec IPC outside the
 *   `ok:pty:*` framing, and the surface is the smallest faithful PTY protocol
 *   (create + the three per-keystroke verbs + the flow-control ack). Streaming
 *   output + exit ride `EventChannels` (`ok:pty:data` / `ok:pty:exit`), not
 *   here. The typed-ipc migration remains the committed end state; this is a
 *   scoped exception with the `ipc-channels.ts` header commitment updated in
 *   lock-step (per the same rule the share-receive + sharing additions followed).
 *
 * Bumped from 71 to 72 with the docked-terminal Claude Code readiness surface:
 *
 *   - `ok:terminal:claude-assist` — a SINGLE discriminated channel carrying
 *     both the `preflight` read (is `claude` on the login-shell PATH; is the
 *     `open-knowledge` MCP server wired into `~/.claude.json`) and the `rewire`
 *     action (show the MCP consent dialog so the user can wire it). Folded into
 *     one channel via the `ok:sharing:dispatch` discriminated-args precedent
 *     (+1, not +2). It is NOT an arbitrary-exec channel and so does NOT belong
 *     in the `ok:pty:*` framing: the renderer supplies only the `action`
 *     discriminant; main runs a FIXED `command -v claude` probe and arms the
 *     existing consent flow — no renderer-supplied command ever executes. Could
 *     not fold into `ok:pty:create` (per-spawn lifecycle, no readiness/rewire
 *     semantics) nor into the `ok:mcp-wiring:*` channels (those are the consent
 *     dialog's confirm/skip/ready responses, not a terminal-side trigger).
 *     The typed-ipc migration remains the committed end state; scoped exception
 *     with the `ipc-channels.ts` header commitment updated in lock-step.
 *
 * Lowered from 72 to 71 with the removal of the external-Terminal.app
 * `ok:shell:open-in-terminal` channel (the in-app docked terminal replaces it).
 * The ratchet tracks downward on genuine channel removals so the cap stays
 * tight against the actual surface.
 *
 * Bumped from 71 to 74 with the docked-terminal reload-survival surface
 * (sessions vanished from the dock after a renderer reload because the surviving
 * main-process PTYs were unreachable):
 *
 *   - `ok:pty:list` — the reload-rehydration inventory: the live ptyIds for the
 *     sender's window, so a reloaded dock rediscovers the shells that survived
 *     in main. A read returning an array; could not fold into `ok:pty:create`
 *     (per-spawn lifecycle, returns one NEW ptyId) — opposite direction and
 *     shape. Stays in `ok:pty:*` per the STOP rule (no exec surface elsewhere).
 *   - `ok:pty:adopt` — rebinds a surviving session to the reloaded renderer
 *     (refresh delivery target, clear the backpressure the dead page stranded,
 *     resume the host) and returns liveness so the panel falls back to a fresh
 *     create on a TOCTOU dead session. Could not fold into the fire-and-forget
 *     `input`/`resize`/`kill` (no result) nor `create` (spawns new) — it is a
 *     mutate-with-typed-result against an EXISTING shell. Stays in `ok:pty:*`.
 *   - `ok:terminal:dock-state` — reads the per-window dock visibility main
 *     retains (WRITTEN via the existing `ok:editor:view-menu-state-changed`
 *     push, so no new write channel) so a reloaded renderer restores an expanded
 *     dock. A read of UI-chrome state, orthogonal to `ok:terminal:claude-assist`
 *     (readiness/rewire) — folding would conflate two responsibilities.
 *
 *   All three extend existing namespaces (`ok:pty:*`, `ok:terminal:*`) rather
 *   than introducing new ones, and the visibility WRITE reused an existing
 *   channel rather than adding one. The typed-ipc migration remains the
 *   committed end state; this is a scoped exception with the `ipc-channels.ts`
 *   header commitment updated in lock-step.
 *
 * Bumped from 74 to 75 to reconcile a merge collision: two concurrently-approved
 * PRs each claimed the single free slot the base tree had at 74. The worktree
 * selector added `ok:worktree:dispatch` (already a fold — list + create ride one
 * discriminated dispatch channel, `ok:*` STOP framing keeps worktree ops off the
 * generic project surface), and the terminal-controls PR added
 * `ok:terminal:cli-installed-map` (extends the existing `ok:terminal:*`
 * namespace). Neither individually exceeded the cap; their union does. Both are
 * already reviewed and needed, and further folding worktree-dispatch into an
 * unrelated surface would be a worse design, so the cap moves to 75. The
 * typed-ipc migration remains the committed end state before any NET-NEW batch.
 *
 * Bumped from 75 to 76 merging the desktop startup-instrumentation surface,
 * which landed on main in parallel; the merge unions both new channels so the
 * cap follows their sum:
 *
 *   - `ok:startup:renderer-marks` — the renderer reports its two launch
 *     checkpoints (page-list ready, first content) as epoch-ms once both land,
 *     so main can fold them into the single `desktop.startup-timeline`
 *     waterfall log. A fire-and-forget push (`result: undefined`); could not
 *     fold into `ok:theme:applied` (a different signal on a different edge —
 *     theme-applied fires on the show-gate edge + matchMedia changes, these
 *     fire once content is usable) nor `ok:editor:*` (editor-area state, not a
 *     launch metric). New `ok:startup:*` namespace, single member.

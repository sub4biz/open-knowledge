# bun-install-ci.sh — retry wrapper around `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
# for use in Open Knowledge CI workflows.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Bun has no built-in retry for tarball-fetch / tarball-extract failures
#   (oven-sh/bun#26879 — still open as of 2026-05). A single transient
#   registry/CDN hiccup during the network phase aborts the whole install
#   with exit 1 and turns a CI job red on noise. We have seen this shape
#   recur on the OK validation job — different transitive packages, same
#   path (cache-miss → resolve OK → fail during extract), the trigger is
#   whichever tarball happens to be in flight at the upstream blip. The
#   bug class is package-agnostic; specific run IDs live in the PR that
#   landed this wrapper (search git log for `bun-install-ci`).
#
#   A second shape is a HANG, not a fast failure: on a cold cache the
#   network phase can stall indefinitely (bun 1.3.x has no install/network
#   idle timeout — `bun install --help` exposes only --network-concurrency).
#   A stalled process never exits, so a retry-on-exit wrapper alone never
#   engages — the hang rides the GitHub job to its `timeout-minutes` cap,
#   which CANCELS the whole job (and any required gate it feeds) and cannot
#   retry. The per-attempt watchdog below converts that hang into a
#   bounded, retryable non-zero exit.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile` (or whatever is in $BUN_INSTALL_CMD)
#   up to $BUN_INSTALL_MAX_ATTEMPTS times, sleeping
#   $BUN_INSTALL_RETRY_SLEEP_BASE * 2^(n-1) seconds between attempts
#   (5s, 10s for the prod default of 3 attempts at 5s base). Each attempt is
#   bounded by a $BUN_INSTALL_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT-second watchdog: a hung attempt
#   is SIGTERM'd (then SIGKILL'd after a grace window) and counts as a
#   retryable failure. Emits a GitHub Actions ::warning:: annotation per
#   retry (distinguishing a timeout from an ordinary failure) and a single
#   ::error:: annotation on final exhaustion so the noise is visible in the
#   Actions UI without masking persistent failures.
#
# WHY NOT SOMETHING ELSE
#   - Wider Bun cache scope is orthogonal — it reduces frequency of cold
#     installs but does not remove the failure mode. Pair with retry, do
#     not substitute.
#   - `.bun-version` bump: oven-sh/bun#26879 is still open. When it lands,
#     remove this wrapper and the workflow call sites.
#   - GNU `timeout` / `gtimeout` for the per-attempt bound: not portable —
#     neither ships with base macOS, and GitHub's macos runner images do not
#     guarantee GNU coreutils. The watchdog here is pure bash so it behaves
#     identically on the Linux and macOS runners.
#   - A GitHub Actions step-level `timeout-minutes` on the install step would
#     fail faster but still only CANCELS (red, no retry). The point is to
#     self-heal, so the bound lives here where a retry can follow it.
#   - Inline retry at each call site: 11 call sites in total — 5 in
#     public-open-knowledge-validation.yml, 3 in root .github/workflows/
#     (beta-cut, main-reset, mirror-sync), and 3 in OK-mirrored workflows
#     (release.yml, desktop-release.yml, desktop-build.yml). Centralizing
#     keeps the retry knobs in one place.
#
# ENV
#   BUN_INSTALL_CMD                Path to the install executable. Default:
#                                  unset, meaning the script runs
#                                  `bun install --frozen-lockfile` directly.
#                                  Tests inject a stub script here. The
#                                  wrapper does not gate this on a "test
#                                  mode" flag — fork-PR security is enforced
#                                  upstream by reviewer-approval and the
#                                  gate-job pattern, not by this script.
#   BUN_INSTALL_MAX_ATTEMPTS       Total attempts (default: 3). Must be a
#                                  positive integer. 1 means "no retry,
#                                  just run once".
#   BUN_INSTALL_RETRY_SLEEP_BASE   Base seconds between retries (default: 5).
#                                  Must be a non-negative integer. Doubled
#                                  each retry: 5s, 10s, 20s. Tests pass 0.
#   BUN_INSTALL_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT    Per-attempt wall-clock budget in seconds
#                                  (default: 240). Must be a non-negative
#                                  integer; 0 disables the watchdog (run the
#                                  install unbounded). The default is chosen
#                                  to stay under a 15-min job cap even if
#                                  every attempt times out AND ignores SIGTERM
#                                  (so the watchdog burns the full grace
#                                  window before SIGKILL):
#                                  3 * (240s + 10s grace) + backoff (5s + 10s)
#                                  ≈ 12.75 min < 15 min. A healthy cold install
#                                  finishes well inside 240s.
#   BUN_INSTALL_KILL_GRACE         Seconds to wait after SIGTERM before
#                                  SIGKILL when a timed-out attempt ignores
#                                  the term signal (default: 10). Non-negative
#                                  integer. Tests pass a small value.
#
# EXIT
#   0 on success at any attempt.
#   64 on invalid input (per sysexits.h EX_USAGE).
#   124 when the final attempt timed out (GNU `timeout` convention).
#   Last attempt's exit code on retry exhaustion otherwise.
#
# CALL FORM (workflow YAML)
#   - run: bash scripts/bun-install-ci.sh
#
# OPEN QUESTIONS
#   - oven-sh/bun#26879 is unresolved upstream. The failure-mode shape
#     (whether ~/.bun/install/cache gets poisoned on extract failure) is
#     unknown. The wrapper does NOT clean the cache between retries — if
#     exhausted retries become common (third recurrence of the same
#     package across runs, or a pattern of "all 3 attempts fail same"),
#     either add targeted cache cleanup or escalate upstream.
